### 💫 About Me:



<!--
**GauthierJARY/GauthierJARY** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
I'm currently M.Sc. student in Aerospace Engineering 👋🔭 at the Royal Institute of Technology KTH (Stockholm, Sweden). I code to solve engineering tasks involving equations solving, problem visualisation or even modelling physical phenomena. Indeed, coding is more than a simple tool, it is part of learning and playing with Physics! You can contact me through my Linkedin account if you have any request regarding my digital projects. 💬📫
